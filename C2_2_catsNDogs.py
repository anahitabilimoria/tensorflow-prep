"""From the results above, you'll see the training accuracy is more than 90%, and the validation accuracy is in the 70%-80% range. This is a great example of _overfitting_ -- which in short means that it can do very well with images it has seen before, but not so well with images it hasn't.

## Data augmentation

One simple method to avoid overfitting is to augment the images a bit. If you think about it, most pictures of a cat are very similar -- the ears are at the top, then the eyes, then the mouth etc. Things like the distance between the eyes and ears will always be quite similar too. 

What if you tweak with the images a bit -- rotate the image, squash it, etc.  That's what image augementation is all about. And there's an API that makes it easy!

Take a look at the [ImageDataGenerator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator) which you have been using to rescale the image. There are other properties on it that you can use to augment the image. 

```
# Updated to do image augmentation
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
      rotation_range=40,
      width_shift_range=0.2,
      height_shift_range=0.2,
      shear_range=0.2,
      zoom_range=0.2,
      horizontal_flip=True,
      fill_mode='nearest')
```

These are just a few of the options available. Let's quickly go over it:

* `rotation_range` is a value in degrees (0â€“180) within which to randomly rotate pictures.
* `width_shift` and `height_shift` are ranges (as a fraction of total width or height) within which to randomly translate pictures vertically or horizontally.
* `shear_range` is for randomly applying shearing transformations.
* `zoom_range` is for randomly zooming inside pictures.
* `horizontal_flip` is for randomly flipping half of the images horizontally. This is relevant when there are no assumptions of horizontal assymmetry (e.g. real-world pictures).
* `fill_mode` is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which can appear after a rotation or a width/height shift.


Run the next cells to see the impact on the results. The code is similar to the baseline but the definition of `train_datagen` has been updated to use the parameters described above.

      validation_steps=50,  # 1000 images = batch_size * steps
      verbose=2)

# Plot the results of training with data augmentation
plot_loss_acc(history_with_aug)

"""As you can see, the training accuracy has gone down compared to the baseline. This is expected because (as a result of data augmentation) there are more variety in the images so the model will need more runs to learn from them. The good thing is the validation accuracy is no longer stalling and is more in line with the training results. This means that the model is now performing better on unseen data.

## Wrap Up

This exercise showed a simple trick to avoid overfitting. You can improve your baseline results by simply tweaking the same images you have already. The `ImageDataGenerator` class has built-in parameters to do just that. Try to modify the values some more in the `train_datagen` and see what results you get.

Take note that this will not work for all cases. In the next lesson, Laurence will show a scenario where data augmentation will not help improve your validation accuracy.
